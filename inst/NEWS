Changes in version 1.0.1 (2019-05-20)
+ Improved when the clustering is defined for groups when running in sample mode.
+ Fixed support for NA to be understood as an output_format value to plot_cnv() in case a user only wants to generate the text outputs and not the plot.
+ Fix ordering of cells and color bars on the heatmap and text outputs when cells are not sorted in the same order in the input matrix and the annotation file.
+ Fix to (sub)cluster definition when a group only has 1 cell.
+ Fix plot_cnv() to handle observations groups with only 1 cell (that can't be hierarchically clustered), a single reference group when no references are not clusterd, and a single reference group with a single cell.
Changes in version 1.0.0 (2019-05-02)
+ Released as a BioConductor packages
Changes in version 0.99.8 (2019-04-20)
+ Fix missing labels on heatmap due to change in how axis() handles overlaps.
+ Improve auto thresholding of heatmap colors to still work when using stronger denoise settings.
+ Updated some examples to use tempfile() for output.
+ Fix duplicate piece of code that produced an error when using plot_steps.
Changes in version 0.99.0 (2019-03-15)
